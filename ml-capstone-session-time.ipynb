    "# Identifying attacker application sessions through supervised learning over known attacker sessions\n",
    "## Project Domain\n",
    "This project bears on the domain of security. I work for a company that publishes expensive content on the web, making it available to subscribers only. We frequently discover cases in which attackers have stolen credentials from our customers and use them to perform unauthorized content downloads. Detecting such activity quickly, without human analysis, has always been difficult given the large amounts of data involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a selection of log data containing records that describe different usage activities, determine whether a given session is likely to describe unauthorized content access. This project will use known attacker data as labeled examples supporting a supervised learning approach. I will use a supervised learning approach on labeled input data that includes both attacker sessions and “innocent” sessions, hoping to produce a model that can predict a high percentage of attack sessions with very low false positives. A successful proof of concept would identify 70% of attacker sessions with no more than 5% false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets and Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- known-attacker.txt–afilecontaininglogentriescollectedfromsessions manually identified as belonging to known attackers. Covering a span of around two years, this file contains ~60K attacker events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- mixed1-3.txt – files containing an unfiltered selection of time intervals known to contain attacker activities. These files contain a total of ~200K events, of which less than 0.5% are attacker events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The events in each file are recorded as tab-separated rows in the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "SessionNo LogTime CustID GroupID ProfID Act BadActor\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘SessionNo’ column groups activities into sets of consecutive user actions, each of which is identified with an ‘Act’ column that identified what the user did, e.g., logged in, performed a search, downloaded content. The CustID, GroupID, and ProfID columns identify unique customer organizations, and are not expected to be useful in the learning exercise per se.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each file has been labeled manually with a notation whether each event belongs to an attacker session. The ‘BadActor’ column indicates whether the given event belongs to an attacker session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the low ratio of attacker to innocent events in the mixed files, I expect it will be necessary to augment the data to improve training results. [2016, Buczakak and Guven] suggests dropping negative rows or duplicating positive rows; I plan to augment training data using the long history of attacker-only rows in known-attacker.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "I will train a binary classifier model to distinguish attacker sessions from normal usage. My hypothesis is that attacker activity is distinctly different from normal usage in at least the following ways:\n",
    "• An attacker logs in and begins downloading one ebook after another. A normal user will perform topic, title or author searches, read a few pages, and search again, browsing several pieces of content before choosing any one work to download.\n",
    "• An attacker tends not to pause for long intervals between content accesses. A normal user will read at least part of a work before moving on to the next.\n",
    "• An attacker’s session will often not last as long as a normal research session. After completing an attack, the attacker leaves immediately, while a researcher will do homework or study for hours.\n",
    "These three distinctions suggest several approaches for feature engineering:\n",
    "• Our logs distinguish around 40 distinct actions that users take when performing\n",
    "research. Derive features that represent these actions across the course of a session.\n",
    "• A straightforward method to model user think-time is to calculate some simple session metrics. Average think-time and (possibly) standard deviation of think-time seem likely\n",
    "to capture a large fraction of the difference between attack and research.\n",
    "• Session length should be easy to calculate and populate as a feature of a session.\n",
    "My overall goal is to produce a model that will allow me to evaluate past log files looking for evidence of attacks, so that this information can be used to create rules in our perimeter security devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prior research\n",
    "As far as I can see, the problem of identifying attackers from logs of activities at the business- use-case level has not been thoroughly researched. I did find numerous papers on analysis of net flows and HTTP logs that can be read for useful parallel techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pietraszek, Tadeusz and Axel Tanner. “Data mining and machine learning - Towards reducing false positives in intrusion detection.” Inf. Sec. Techn. Report 10 (2005): 169-183. Uses machine learning to identify candidate alerts from an IDS for human labeling. Labels are used in supervised learning to refine selection of alerts.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Benchmark Model & Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "The total volume of known attacker traffic is extremely low, less than .05% for a given victim. My approach to computing a baseline is to assume that *P(attack)* for a given row is 0. I will compare the confusion matrix for this baseline to the one for predictions from my ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Design\n",
    "I will execute the following plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the data into Jupyter & SageMaker in order to study it in place 2. Choose an approach for feature engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Can I engineer a session row that contains enough information to produce a useful result in one of the algorithms I’ve already used, like XGBoost?\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Do I need to use LSTM or convolution or some other learning algorithm with a memory that can learn sequences?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Produce a repeatable process that can convert our raw log file into a dataset that my chosen algorithm can process\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Train a model, and execute the model against labelled data in batch transform mode 5. Use the result to calculate true and false positives and negatives. Given the small population of positive results – attacker session are a small fraction of total traffic – precision and recall are the most important metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. High precision means that my false positive rate is low. It’s critical not to misidentify innocent traffic as malicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. High recall is the next most important metric. I need to identify as great a fraction of actual attack traffic as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set includes the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "|File       |Rows                             |Contents|\n",

    "|mixed-3.txt|30844|raw transactions|\n",
    "|known-attacker.txt|61917|raw transactions for a known attacker|\n",
    "\n",
    "All files include a 'BadActor' column that labels a transaction as belonging to a known attacker or not. The 'mixed-' files consist of whole hours of activity in which there is an attack, while known-attacker.txt contains all attacks for the known attacker over the last two years. In all, we have 193926 transactions from \"innocent\" sessions and 61917 LT transactions. Approximately 32% of transactions are labeled BadActor = 1, giving us a reasonable proportion in both classes."

    "\n",
    "We had additional ideas for modeling the data while staying in this bag-of-transaction technique.\n",
    "1. Try some hyperparameter tuning to seem if the success rates can be trivially improved.\n",
    "1. Enrich the training data set in various ways - add colums to summarize total session time, average time/request, and so on.\n",
    "1. Perform some clustering analysis to try to identify common patterns of behavior other than LT. This may reveal the presence of other kinds of harvesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qualifying the approach\n",
    "Can we use this approach to identify and blacklist harvesting sessions as they occur? Some notes:\n",
    "1. The approach must be resilient to easy efforts to evade. Does the accuracy of the identification drop if the attacker makes minor changes to his workflow?\n",
    "1. How long does it take to identify an attacker in real time? \n",
    "    1. Do we gain certainty soon enough to stop an attacker before he's done what he came to do?\n",
    "    2. Can we tag sessions accurately after the first N log entries, for instance?\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Designing an implementation\n",
    "Design an architecture for identifying and intercepting harvesting activity in real time. Confirm data sources, manage impact to usage latency, model costs and ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's world, it would be less effective to perform real-time analysis on AWS, since all of our current content usage is on-prem. The algorithm used here, XGBoost, is performant on commodity hardware, so we may be able to run on standard VMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-time analysis, we will face a stream of events from interleaved sessions. We will have to demultiplex these into individual event streams both for training and for prediction, implying some kind of windowing to capture and send sets of log entries as partial sessions. It's not clear how big the impact of this windowing will be on the accuracy of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Other analytical techniques\n",
    "While this algorithm seems promising, we're throwing away a huge amount of intelligence before we start training, in the name of simplicity. We can evaluate what kind of gains we could achieve through more advanced techniques:\n",
    "- Stateful models like LSTM or CNN\n",
